# prompt: synchronize tasks/assignments from external platforms into the application, maintaining a mapping between external and internal items to track updates and avoid duplicates principle: After a user connects an external source (like Canvas) with their credentials, they can fetch assignments from that source. The system remembers which external assignments have already been imported, so subsequent syncs only import new or updated assignments. Users can refresh to get latest changes from the source.
