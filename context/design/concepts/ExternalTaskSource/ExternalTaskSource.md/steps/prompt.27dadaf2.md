# prompt: Fix the following errors in the ExternalAssignmentSync concept specification. First, the concept has too many generic parameters and ExternalSourceAccount should be an entity type managed by the concept, not a generic parameter. The concept should use only User and Assignment as generic parameters. Second, there is no association between sources and users - the spec is missing which user owns each source connection, making it impossible to query what sources a specific user has. Third, the spec is missing error handling actions for invalid credentials, network failures, API rate limits, and attempting to disconnect a source that doesn't exist. Fourth, the ConnectionDetails type is too abstract - for Canvas specifically we need to store an API token and base URL, so this should be more concrete. Fifth, sources are missing identification fields like sourceType (to distinguish Canvas vs GitHub) and sourceName (user-friendly label like "6.104 Canvas") to distinguish between multiple Canvas courses. Sixth, the fetchUpdates action does too much by both fetching from the external API and determining what to process, which violates single responsibility - this should be separated into the platform API call and the comparison logic. Please revise the concept specification to address all these issues while maintaining the core purpose of synchronizing assignments from external platforms and preventing duplicates.
