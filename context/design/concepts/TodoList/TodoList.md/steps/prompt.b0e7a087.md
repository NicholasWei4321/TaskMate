# prompt: Create a formal concept specification for a TodoList concept that allows users to organize collections of items. The concept should be generic and work with any Item type. It should support creating lists with names, adding items to lists, removing items from lists, deleting entire lists, and retrieving lists for a user. The concept should be parameterized by User and Item.
