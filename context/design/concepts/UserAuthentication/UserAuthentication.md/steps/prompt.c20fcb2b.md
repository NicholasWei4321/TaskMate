# prompt: Create a formal concept specification for a UserAuthentication concept that handles user registration, login, logout, and credential management. The concept should store usernames, hashed passwords, and optional additional credentials (like Canvas login info for future use). It should support registering new users, authenticating users with username/password, managing active sessions, and storing/retrieving user credentials securely. The concept should be parameterized by User.
