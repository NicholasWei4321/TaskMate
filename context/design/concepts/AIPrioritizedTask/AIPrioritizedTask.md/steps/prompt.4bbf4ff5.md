# prompt: Create a formal concept specification for an AIPrioritizedTask concept. This concept should track actionable items (tasks) with name, description, due date, completion status, and overdue status. The concept should support basic task operations (create, snooze, complete, markLate) and calculate priority scores using both time-based urgency and LLM-inferred attributes (effort in hours, importance 1-10, difficulty 1-10). The LLM estimation should validate attributes and fall back to time-based priority if validation fails. The concept should be parameterized by User.
